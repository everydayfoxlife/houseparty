<h1>Welcome to your very own MAGE application!</h1>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<h3>Documentation and tools</h3>

For documentation and tools, you can access the MAGE dashboard here:
<a href="/app/dev">/app/dev</a>.
Once there, click on <a href="/app/dev#docs/node_modules/mage">Documentation</a>
to get more information about how to use MAGE.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

Configuration files can be found in the <b>mage-templates/config</b> folder. We have created a
special configuration file there called <b>default.yaml</b> that you and your co-workers can use for
shared defaults. You can override and extend the configuration for developers in
<b>development.yaml</b> and add personal customization to your own configuration file
<b>custom.yaml</b>.

<h3>About these web pages</h3>

The page you see before you have been put here to get you started. You will be replacing this
with your own HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. You can find these files in <b>mage-templates/www/pages</b>.

<h2>Off to wonderland you go</h2>

Put on your wizard's hat, and have fun!
